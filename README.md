## Michael Dornisch's Personal Fork

If you have come across this repository, it might not work for your printer. This is a fork of the Marlin Release 1.0.2, configured for my printer. It is modified from Folger Tech's original acrylic frame Prusa i3 variant.

##         Michael's Modifications
* Custom X carriage with belt tensioner and (now obsolete) Z endstop adjustment
* Custom CAD'ed bowden extruders using mk8 extruder gears with compression fitting taps on the inlets and outlets.
* Fixed bed with better linear bearing mounts instead of the horrible zip tie solution.
* Custom designed mechanical detatching Z probe utilizing a Cherry MX black keyswitch. [(see video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NZJfOa3XrI)
* Integrated OrangePi PC running Ubuntu 14.04 with [OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/) host software.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
