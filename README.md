## Michael Dornisch's Personal Fork

If you have come across this repository, it might not work for your printer. This is a fork of the Marlin Release 1.0.2, configured for my printer. It is a Prusa I3 from Folger Technologies, but modified with a new X carriage, 2x bowden extruders, and an E3D Chimera dual hotend. All of my work will be done in the currentfw fork.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
